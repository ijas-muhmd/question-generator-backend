      "question": "Q: Which hormone is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake of glucose into cells?\nA) Insulin\nB) Glucagon\nC) Cortisol\nD) Epinephrine\nAnswer: A) Insulin\nExplanation for A: Insulin is produced by the pancreas and is responsible for lowering blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake of glucose into cells for energy production or storage.\nExplanation for B: Glucagon is produced by the pancreas and raises blood sugar levels by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen into glucose in the liver.\nExplanation for C: Cortisol is a stress hormone produced by the adrenal gland that regulates metabolism, immune response, and blood pressure, but does not directly regulate blood sugar levels.\nExplanation for D: Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is produced by the adrenal gland and is involved in the fight or flight response but does not directly regulate blood sugar levels.\nReason for A: Insulin is the hormone directly responsible for promoting the uptake of glucose into cells, making it the correct answer.\nReason for B: Glucagon is involved in raising blood sugar levels, not lowering them as required in this scenario.\nReason for C: Cortisol is not primarily involved in regulating blood sugar levels, making it an incorrect choice.\nReason for D: Epinephrine is not primarily responsible for regulating blood sugar levels, making it an incorrect choice.\nStudy Topic A: Functions of insulin in regulating blood sugar levels\nStudy Topic B: Functions of glucagon in regulating blood sugar levels\nStudy Topic C: Role of cortisol in metabolism and stress response\nStudy Topic D: Functions of epinephrine in the fight or flight response",
